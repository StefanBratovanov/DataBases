Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. 

SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a standardized computer language 
that was originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational 
databases, using declarative statements. 
T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, 
various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and 
changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. 

Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate
 with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, 
regardless of the user interface of the application.

* Variables
Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: 
DECLARE, SET and SELECT.

DECLARE @var1 NVARCHAR(30)    
SET @var1 = 'Some Name'       
SELECT @var1 = Name       
FROM Sales.Store       
WHERE CustomerID = 1000

* Flow control
Keywords for flow control in Transact-SQL include :
BEGIN and END, BREAK, CONTINUE, GOTO, IF and ELSE, RETURN, WAITFOR, and WHILE.

* TRY CATCH
Beginning with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft introduced additional TRY CATCH logic to support
 exception type behaviour. This behaviour enables developers to simplify their code 
and leave out @@ERROR checking after each SQL execution statement.
