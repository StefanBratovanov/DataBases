SQL - Structured Query Language is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing
data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL consists of a data definition language(DDL)and a data manipulation language(DML)
*DDL Main commands :
 - CREATE
 - ALTER
 - DROP 
 - DISABLE TRIGGER
 - ENABLE TRIGGER
 - TRUNCATE TABLE
 - UPDATE STATISTICS

*DDL Main commands :
 - SELECT
 - INSERT
 - UPDATE
 - DELETE 

The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and 
data access control.

* Language elements

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:

- Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these
are optional.)
- Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows
of data.
- Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL)
(true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements
and queries, or to change program flow.
- Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element
 of SQL.
- Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, 
or diagnostics.

SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on
 every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar. Insignificant whitespace
 is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries.

example:

SELECT *
 FROM  Book
 WHERE price > 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
