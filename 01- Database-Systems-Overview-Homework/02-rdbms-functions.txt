The main functions of the relational DBMS to manage the organization, storage, access, security and integrity 
of data. This specialized software allows application systems to focus on the user interface, data validation
and screen navigation. When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply
makes a "call" to the RDBMS.

The most common use of RDBMSs is to implement simple CRUD – Create, Read, Update, and Delete – functionality. 
For example an application could create a new order and insert it into your database. It could read an existing order, 
work with the data, and then update the database with the new information. It could also choose to delete an existing order, 
perhaps because the customer has cancelled it.  The vast majority of your interaction with an RDB will likely be to implement basic
CRUD functionality.
