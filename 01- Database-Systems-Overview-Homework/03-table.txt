In databases a table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of 
fields (columns), and rows.

In relational databases and flat file databases, a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical 
columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows. Each row is identified by one or more values 
appearing in a particular column subset. The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row is called the primary key.

There is the difference between a table and relation and it is that a table is usually a multiset (bag) of rows where a relation 
is a set and does not allow duplicates. 

In terms of the relational model of databases, a table can be considered a convenient representation of a relation, 
but the two are not strictly equivalent. For instance, an SQL table can potentially contain duplicate rows, whereas a true relation cannot 
contain duplicate tuples. Similarly, representation as a table implies a particular ordering to the rows and columns, 
whereas a relation is explicitly unordered. However, the database system does not guarantee any ordering of the rows unless an ORDER BY
clause is specified in the SELECT statement that queries the table.
