Integrity constraints are used to ensure accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database. Data integrity
is handled in a relational database through the concept of referential integrity.

* PRIMARY KEY Constraint - uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table

* UNIQUE Constraint -  prevents two records from having identical values in a particular column.

* FOREIGN KEY constraint - ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table

* CHECK constraint - ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

Others:

* NOT NULL constraint - ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
 
* DEFAULT constraint -provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
